                        Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known mainly for his work
                        in the field of light scattering. With his student K. S. Krishnan, he discovered that when light traverses a transparent material,
                        some of the deflected light changes wavelength and amplitude. This phenomenon was a new type of scattering of light and was subsequently
                        termed as the Raman effect (Raman scattering). Raman won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics and was the first Asian person to receive 
                        a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.
